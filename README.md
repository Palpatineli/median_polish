Median polish a non-parametric exploratory statistical method proposed by Tukey.
It assumes an additive model, with constant random marginal effects (e.g.: random (categorical) row and column effect in a two-way table).
This repository contains a python/numpy implementation of this method used on arbitrary dimensional data (only tested with 2 and 3D cases).

This package can be found on pypi as median_polish.
